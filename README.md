# **ANAMOLY DETECTION**

 Anamoly Detection is also known as outlier detection. Let us understand the Outlier in the Laymen language. For instance, you are asked to remove the rotten tomatoes from bucket because if not separated it will also spoil the other good tomatoes.
 
Similarly, there are variable/features/data points which are of no use or making no difference but could be responsible for greater loss. Thus we need to find the Outliers and remove them for better accuracy.

The noise are the data points which are detected as the outliers.
