# **ANAMOLY DETECTION**

 Anamoly Detection is also known as outlier detection. Let us understand the Outlier in the Laymen language. For instance, you are asked to remove the rotten tomatoes from bucket because if not separated it will also spoil the other good tomatoes.
 
Similarly, there are variable/features/data points which are of no use or making no difference but could be responsible for greater loss. Thus we need to find the Outliers and remove them for better accuracy.

The noise are the data points which are detected as the outliers.



***Anamolies and is classifications***

Anamoly is use to identify the rare items, suspcious items, events and outcomes which can raise a harm to the model.

The anamolies have several classifications - 

1. **Point anamolies**
    When a single data point is too far from the rest data points which makes it merely impossible to make the cluster or map it to the data points or cluster then we simply remove such data points. This is called the point anamolies.

2. **Contextual anamolies**
    If the abnormality is context specific, For instance investing 1000 rupee everyday on buying shoe since you play football is normal, but odd anyway.

3. **Collective anamolies**
    A set of data instance is responsible to track this anamoly. If someone is remotely using a machine and extracting the information to the local host. It gives the sign of the cyber attack.
